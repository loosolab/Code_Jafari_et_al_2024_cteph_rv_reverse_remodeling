ABSTRACT:
Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a complex disease with progressive right ventricular (RV) failure and pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) is an established treatment for these patients. RNA-sequencing analysis and histological assessment of RV free wall and septal biopsies obtained from CTEPH patients prior to PEA suggest enrichment and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in comparison with cardiomyocyte cytoskeletal changes in both exploratory (n = 14), and confirmatory cohort (n = 92). Post-PEA tissue sampling documented reversal of the histological and transcriptomic RV abnormalities. A critical role of central signaling molecules (ANKRD1, IL-7R, SERPINE1) in proliferative and fibrogenic processes underlying RV dysfunction and its reversal was shown in human prePEA versus postPEA samples and in experimental in vitro and in vivo models. Our study identified a profile of gene expression changes and myocardial as well as ECM remodeling events, underlying the maladaptive RV response to increased afterload and its reversibility upon unloading, offering novel targets for therapeutic intervention.

This repository contains scripts used to analyze data sets described in this study. We applied a range of existing tools for calculations and visualizations. The repository is divided into separate folders containing miscellaneous scripts (misc) and code specific to data types (RNA-Seq).
